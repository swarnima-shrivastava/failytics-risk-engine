## Glossary

**AI (Artificial Intelligence)**  
The field of building systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.

**ML (Machine Learning)**  
A subset of AI that enables systems to learn patterns from data and make predictions without explicit programming.

**Multi-Agent System (MAS)**  
A system composed of multiple interacting services or agents that coordinate to perform tasks.

**Distributed System**  
A collection of independent services or components that communicate over a network to function as a unified system.

**Telemetry**  
Operational data collected from systems, including logs, metrics, and traces.

**Logs**  
Timestamped records of system events generated by applications or services.

**Metrics**  
Numerical measurements (e.g., latency, error rate, CPU usage) that quantify system performance over time.

**Execution Traces**  
Records of request flows across multiple services, capturing inter-service interactions.

**Failure Event**  
An erroneous or anomalous system behavior indicating degradation or malfunction.

**Failure Risk**  
The estimated probability that a service will experience a failure within a defined future time horizon.

**Observation Window**  
A fixed time interval of historical telemetry used to construct model features.

**Prediction Horizon**  
The future time interval within which the model predicts the likelihood of failure.

**Feature Engineering**  
The process of transforming raw data into structured inputs suitable for machine learning models.

**Supervised Learning**  
A machine learning approach where models are trained using labeled examples.

**Binary Classification**  
A prediction task with two possible outcomes (e.g., failure vs. no failure).

**Class Imbalance**  
A condition where one class (e.g., failure) occurs much less frequently than the other.

**SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)**  
A resampling method that generates synthetic examples of the minority class to address class imbalance during training.

**Logistic Regression**  
A linear supervised learning algorithm used for binary classification tasks.

**Gradient Boosting**  
An ensemble machine learning technique that builds predictive models by sequentially combining weak learners.

**XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)**  
An optimized implementation of gradient boosting designed for performance and scalability.

**LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine)**  
A fast, efficient gradient boosting framework optimized for large-scale structured data.

**PR-AUC (Precision-Recall Area Under Curve)**  
An evaluation metric measuring model performance under class imbalance by analyzing precision-recall trade-offs.

**Precision**  
The proportion of predicted failures that are actual failures.

**Recall**  
The proportion of actual failures correctly identified by the model.

**F1 Score**  
The harmonic mean of precision and recall.

**Top-K Ranking**  
An evaluation method assessing whether true failures appear among the K highest predicted risk scores.

**Explainability**  
Techniques used to interpret and understand how a machine learning model makes predictions.

**SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**  
A method for explaining individual predictions by quantifying feature contributions.

**FastAPI**  
A modern Python framework for building high-performance APIs.

**CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)**  
A structured methodology for guiding data science projects through business understanding, data preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deployment.
