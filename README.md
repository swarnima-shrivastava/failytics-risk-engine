**Predictive Failure Risk Intelligence for Multi-Agent and Distributed Systems**

**Failytics Risk Engine** is an ML-powered engine that predicts the likelihood of service degradation or failure in multi-agent and distributed environments. By analyzing patterns in logs and performance metrics over time, it surfaces emerging instability signals and quantifies short-term failure risk, enabling teams to quantify failure probability intervene before incidents escalate.
